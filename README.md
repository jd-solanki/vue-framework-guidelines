# Vue Framework Guidelines

<details>
<summary>ðŸ’­ Thoughts</summary>

_These are my thoughts feel free to open issue in this repo to discuss this_

- Q: I really like how nuxt is pluggable and we can extend it. It's great power when you use it, I wonder can UI framework be pluggable & extendable.

## Component Design

- Provide both a prop and a named slot for the same data for ultimate flexibility ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/danielkelly_io/status/1742564440287957489) - _tweet image don't use named slot but author mentioned it in thread_)
- You can also go with vuetify's aprroach where you provide additional component with default slot for rendering custom content but with styles from framework.

- For boolean props, use `is-` or `should-` prefix. E.g. `<SomeComponent is-active />`
- Provide [props default](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/features/global-configuration/#setup) like Vuetify
- Provide [virtual components](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/features/global-configuration/#using-with-virtual-components) like Vuetify
- Provide High level component like `<Alert title="CPU Usage is High!" />` for quick prototype & common usage and low level component unstyled component like RadixUI `<Alert><AlertTitle class="text-red font-weight-medium">CPU Usage is High!<AlertTitle></Alert>` for customizing structure and style of the component.
- [Highly Opinionated] Props should be for functionality, class should be for styling & slots should be for content.
- Component transitions should be [customizable](https://anu-vue.netlify.app/guide/features/transitions.html#customizing-transitions).
- [Experimental & RnD] Allow overriding slots content once instead of writing same markup everywhere. E.g. We develop table component and provide pagination slot to override our pagination where we just proide left & right arrow to change page but user want pagination with numbers in this case user has to write same markup (Numbered Pagination) for overriding the pagination component everywhere table component is used. I don't have any way right now for implementing this but I guess @sxzz can help by somehow using [unplugin-macros](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-macros)

## High Level Decisions

- Use CSS where possible instead of JS to make it faster
- Allow using any icon library and configuration to customize the icons used in high level component. E.g. Allow changing arrow icon in accordion or select component.

## Documentation

- Ensure your component have API section and user can search though props,slots & events via single input
  - [UX] If possible provide configuration to keep it on top or bottom of the page according to user preference.
- Documentation should be interactive. You can either make [code editable right in code snippet](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/#basic-button) or provide [link to open code snippet in your framework's playground](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/buttons/#density).
  - Ensure using [Vue REPL playground](https://play.vuejs.org/) instead of CodePen or Sandbox for quick interactivity.
 
## Enterprise Solutions / Advanced

- Allow creating UI via text prompt. Refer to this amazing [tweet](https://twitter.com/zernonia/status/1742945562977251703).
- Allow a way to generate code from Figma Design.
