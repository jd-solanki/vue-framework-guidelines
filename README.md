# Vue Framework Guidelines

- Provide both a prop and a named slot for the same data for ultimate flexibility ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/danielkelly_io/status/1742564440287957489) - _tweet image don't use named slot but author mentioned it in thread_)
- For boolean props, use `is-` or `should-` prefix. E.g. `<SomeComponent is-active />`
